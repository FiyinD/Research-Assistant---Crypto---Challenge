A recursion is a function that calls itself. Whenever a function is called, the computer's call stack (which is a block of memory used for computing the function) is used. Recursion is a bad method for computing a fibonacci number because it takes up space on the computer's call stack (which is limited in size) with each new function call. This means that with a bigger fibonacci number, the available space on the call stack call stack becomes smaller, thereby making the program to run much slower. This may eventually lead to program termination when the space on the call stack runs out.
